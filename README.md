# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

# How to start it on my local machine?

1. git clone https://github.com/brkagithub/ethereum-transaction-crawler.git
2. navigate into the code directory in cmd line
3. npm install
4. npm run dev (or npm run build -> npm run start)

P.S. normally i would delete gitignore the .env file but i want to make it easier to run it on your pc so it's still in the repo.
